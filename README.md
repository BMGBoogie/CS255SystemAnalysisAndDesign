# CS255SystemAnalysisAndDesign

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 
Throughout this semester, we were working with a client called DriverPass who wanted to create an application to help new drivers with learning to drive and passing their driver's test on the first attempt. They wanted an application that can connect driver's with driving teachers and also provide new drivers with the most up-to-date DMV information so that they know what to expect.

What did you do particularly well?
I think that during this project, I did a good job of analyzing the clients requests from the initial meeting and utilizing that data in order to properly identify the expected outcome from the team.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One area of opportunity that I saw when reviewing my documents for the project was my initial UML diagram that I created for DriverPass. While I think that I accurately represented the expectations of the system, I think that I could've improved upon the amount of variables included in the UML and could've been more molecular in my data.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By asking clarifying questions and confirming plans with the customer, you are able to verify understanding of the expectations for the application. Often times we find that customers know what they want, but aren't sure how to make it happen. It is that absence of understanding that we need to alleviate in order to ensure that we are delivering a proper end result.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When it comes to designing software, one of the most beneficial approaches that I have found is to utilize pseudocode in order to understand the expectations and layout of the request going into the scripting phase. Similar to confirming the expecations with the customer, the pseudocode takes that information and builds upon it in a more technical format to assist in writing the program.
